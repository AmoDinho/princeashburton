# Home of Prince Ashburton 👨‍🚀

This is the repo for my corner of the internet! The plan is put links to the stuff I'm working on here, as well as a blog.

## Specs

This front-end basically uses Gridsome as a Static site generator, which is powered by VueJS. Then I've used TailwindCSS to help me with styling. 

## License 

This repo has an MIT license, but please do not steal my projects and claim them as yours!
